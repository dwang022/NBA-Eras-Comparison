## Abstract
Jordan or LeBron: Who is the “GOAT”? Cross-era comparisons are often at the center of NBA discussions, but the style of play in the NBA has changed drastically over time, making it nearly impossible to directly compare players from different eras. In this article, I will analyze how the game of basketball has evolved over time using data from Basketball Reference, then use this information to discuss two approaches to more accurately compare players from different eras.
